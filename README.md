# Portfolio – Vilde Svenkesen

Welcome to my personal portfolio! 🎨  
This is a simple, responsive website created to showcase my skills and projects as a developer. The portfolio is built with a lightweight and clean design, just how I like it. I have also added tiny details to the page that reflects my interests in Pokémon.
