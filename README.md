# Portfolio – Vilde Svenkesen

Welcome to my personal portfolio! 🎨  
This is a simple, responsive website created to showcase my skills and projects as a developer. The portfolio is built with a lightweight and clean design, just how I like it.  

I have added **interactive elements and subtle Pokémon-inspired details** throughout the page, including:

- **Pokédex-inspired Projects** – Each GitHub project is displayed like a Pokédex entry, showing its name, type (mapped from the tech used), and year (Generation).  
- **Skills Type Mapping** – My skills are associated with Pokémon types, providing a fun and intuitive way to understand my tech stack.  
- **Gengar Animation** – The Gengar character moves dynamically between navigation buttons, adding personality while keeping the design clean.
